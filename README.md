# Project: Predicting Your Chance Of Admission For A Masters Degree
This project deals with the notion of using artificial neural networks in order to predict the chances of a person getting into the master's degree of a university, based on some critical factors such as the test scores and if that person had any research experience. More information on the dataset will be included below. This project is a failure of a project not because of the weak neural network but also because of the lack of data. This dataset, [extracted](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv) from Kaggle, contains 5000 people and their scores. No scaling of the data was required. Below is some information of the paramaters.
